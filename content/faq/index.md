## General

### What is Futminna Developers Circle?

Federal University of Technology Minna Developers Circle (FDC) envision a technological community for the students in and outside FUTMinna to promote and encourage global technological advancement, where we network, learn and innovate to foster the spirit of research and in-depth studying in areas of science and technology especially information and communication technology through meetups, training, study group, conference, sharing first-hand information on latest trends in technology as well as opportunities in the Industries to developers. In the past we hosted Google Hashcode and had some of our developers in the top ranks (first, third and fifth) nationwide. With the series of meetups held, we have helped groom a group of developers with diverse skills like web and mobile development, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, design, etc.

### Organizing communities

Futminna DevCircle is the brain child of a select group of an over-vitaminated founders/administrators solidly backed by our ever-present staff advisors.
